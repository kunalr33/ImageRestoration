# Image_restoration Using The Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network

 we will be deploying the super-resolution convolution neural network (SRCNN) using Keras. This network was published in the paper, "Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks" by Chao Dong, et al. in 2014.

The SRCNN is a deep convolutional neural network that learns end-to-end mapping of low resolution to high resolution images. 


To evaluate the performance of this network, we will be using three image quality metrics: peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), mean squared error (MSE), and the structural similarity (SSIM) index.
